.SH NAME
cups\-files.conf \- file and directory configuration file for cups
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBcups\-files.conf\fR file configures the files and directories used by the CUPS scheduler,
.BR cupsd (8).
It is normally located in the \fI/etc/cups\fR directory.
.LP
Each line in the file can be a configuration directive, a blank line, or a comment.
Comment lines start with the # character.
.SS DIRECTIVES
The following directives are understood by
.BR cupsd (8):
.TP 5
\fBAccessLog \fIfilename\fR
.TP 5
\fBAccessLog \fR[ \fIfilename\fR ]
.TP 5
\fBAccessLog syslog\fR
Defines the access log filename.
The value "syslog" causes log entries to be sent to the system log daemon.
Specifying a blank filename disables access log generation.
The server name may be included in filenames using the string "%s", for example:
.nf

    AccessLog /var/log/cups/%s-access_log

.fi
.TP 5
\fBConfigFilePerm \fImode\fR
Specifies the permissions for all configuration files that the scheduler writes.
The default is 0644 on OS X and 0640 on all other operating systems.
\fBNote:\fR The permissions for the printers.conf file are currently masked to only allow access from the scheduler user (typically root).
This is done because printer device URIs sometimes contain sensitive authentication information that should not be generally known on the system.
There is no way to disable this security feature.
.TP 5
\fBDataDir \fIpath\fR
Specifies the directory where data files can be found. The default is usually \fI/usr/share/cups\fR.
.TP 5
\fBDocumentRoot \fIdirectory\fR
Specifies the root directory for the CUPS web interface content. The default is usually \fI/usr/share/doc/cups\fR.
.TP 5
\fBErrorLog \fR[ \fIfilename\fR ]
.TP 5
\fBErrorLog syslog\fR
Defines the error log filename.
The value "syslog" causes log entries to be sent to the system log daemon.
Specifying a blank filename disables error log generation.
The server name may be included in filenames using the string "%s", for example:
.nf

    ErrorLog /var/log/cups/%s-error_log

.fi
.TP 5
\fBFatalErrors none\fR
.TP 5
\fBFatalErrors all \fI\-kind \fR[ \fI... \-kind \fR]
.TP 5
\fBFatalErrors \fIkind \fR[ \fI... kind \fR]
Specifies which errors are fatal, causing the scheduler to exit.
The default setting is "config".
The \fIkind\fR strings are:
.RS 5
.TP 5
.B none
No errors are fatal.
.TP 5
.B all
All of the errors below are fatal.
.TP 5
.B browse
Browsing initialization errors are fatal, for example failed connections to the DNS-SD daemon.
.TP 5
.B config
Configuration file syntax errors are fatal.
.TP 5
.B listen
Listen or Port errors are fatal, except for IPv6 failures on the loopback or "any" addresses.
.TP 5
.B log
Log file creation or write errors are fatal.
.TP 5
.B permissions
Bad startup file permissions are fatal, for example shared TLS certificate and key files with world-read permissions.
.RE
.TP 5
\fBFileDevice Yes\fR
.TP 5
\fBFileDevice No\fR
Specifies whether the file pseudo-device can be used for new printer queues.
The URI "file:///dev/null" is always allowed.
.TP 5
\fBFontPath \fIdirectory\fR[:\fI...\fR:\fIdirectory\fR]
Specifies the search path for fonts.
\fBThis directive is deprecated and will no longer be supported in a future release of CUPS.\fR
.TP 5
\fBGroup \fIgroup-name-or-number\fR
Specifies the group name or ID that will be used when executing external programs.
The default group is operating system specific but is usually \fIlp\fR or \fInobody\fR.
.TP 5
\fBLogFilePerm \fImode\fR
Specifies the permissions of all log files that the scheduler writes. The default is 0644.
.TP 5
\fBPageLog \fR[ \fIfilename\fR ]
.TP 5
\fBPageLog syslog\fR
Defines the page log filename.
The value "syslog" causes log entries to be sent to the system log daemon.
Specifying a blank filename disables page log generation.
The server name may be included in filenames using the string "%s", for example:
.nf

    PageLog /var/log/cups/%s-page_log

.fi
.TP 5
\fBPrintcap \fR[ \fIfilename\fR ]
Defines the printcap filename that the scheduler automatically updates with the current list of available printers, which is sometimes used by legacy applications.

\fBThis directive is deprecated and will no longer be supported in a future release of CUPS.\fR
.TP 5

Specifies the username that is associated with unauthenticated accesses by clients claiming to be the root user.
