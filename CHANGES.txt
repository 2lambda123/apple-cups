CHANGES IN CUPS V2.0b1

	- Dropped OpenSSL support in favor of GNU TLS.
	- Dropped "dark wake" support on OS X, which was preventing portables
	  from going to sleep when there was a stuck job. We now use a variation
	  of the CUPS 1.4 sleep support to do a cleaner sleep
	  (<rdar://problem/14323704>)
	- Dropped support for AIX, HP-UX, and OSF/1 (aka Digital UNIX)
	- Added support for regular expression matching in the MIME type rules
	  (<rdar://problem/11131245>)
	- cupsRasterInterpretPPD now supports the Orientation header in order to
	  support long-edge feed raster printers (<rdar://problem/15837926>)
	- The filter/backend sandbox on OS X now defaults to a more strict
	  whitelist (<rdar://problem/15939788>)
	- Increased the default idle exit timeout to 60 seconds on OS X
	  (<rdar://problem/16041820>)
