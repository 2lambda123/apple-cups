CUPS 1.5.2 is now available from:

    http://www.cups.org/software.html

The new release fixes the tarballs released as CUPS 1.5.1, which through an error in the distribution script and a lack of secondary checks was tagged from trunk (CUPS 1.6.x) instead of the CUPS 1.5.x branch.  The script has been updated with additional checks to prevent this from happening again, and the 1.5.2 release has been tagged from the correct branch.
