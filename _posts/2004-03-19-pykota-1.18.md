Many bugs were fixed, especially wrt users and printers groups which can now be nested to an arbitrary depth. Some new command line utilities and configuration directives were added. Speed was improved at different places, especially when managing several thousands of users on many printers. An Italian translation was added. Pluggable hooks at job start/end are now entirely configurable. Sample print quota reports made from within OpenOffice.org are now included, as well as some preliminary Debian packaging specific files.
