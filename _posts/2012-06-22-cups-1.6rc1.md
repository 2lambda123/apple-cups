CUPS 1.6rc1 is now available at:

    http://www.cups.org/software.html

The new release fixes a few small bugs and adds a Japanese localization. Changes include:


- Added a new Japanese localization (Issue #4122)
- The SNMP backend no longer exits if it is unable to obtain an IPv6 socket (Issue #4109)
- The LPD backend incorrectly used "localhost" in the control file instead of the current hostname.

Enjoy!
