<P>A new log viewing application is now available for ESP Print Pro on Linux, MacOS X, and Solaris SPARC. The log viewer provides a graphical view of the printing system error log and provides descriptions of each error message as well as a quick-diagnosis action which often can determine the cause of printing problems and suggest remedies.<P>The new tool is available free of charge to all ESP Print Pro and CUPS users and will eventually be provided as part of the standard ESP Print Pro release. Please report all problems using the bug reporting form on the ESP Print Pro product page.
