The first beta release of CUPS 1.3 is now available for download from:

     http://www.cups.org/software.html

As per the CUPS Configuration Management Plan, we now start our two week "soak" of each beta release. Once we are happy with the quality, we'll move on to another period of release candidates. If you experience problems with this beta, please post your issues to the cups.general forum or mailing list. Confirmed bug reports should be posted to the Bugs &amp; Features page. 
CUPS 1.3 adds Kerberos and mDNS (Bonjour) support along with over 30 new features. Changes include:
- Copyright updates - CUPS is now owned by Apple Inc. 
- Documentation updates (Issue #1775, Issue #2027, Issue #2130, Issue #2131, Issue #2263, Issue #2356, Issue #2397) 
- Added new cupsfilter utility (Issue #1734) 
- Added new job-printer-state-message and job-printer-state-reasons attributes to jobs (Issue #2418) 
- Added LDAP+SSL support (Issue #1967) 
- CUPS now supports authentication via peer credentials over domain sockets (Issue #2242, Issue #2277) 
- The CUPS sample driver PPDs are now generated by the PPD compiler and include all of the localized languages by default (Issue #2164) 
- You can now specify "AuthType Default" in the cupsd.conf file to use the default authentication defined by the DefaultAuthType directive. 
- The SNMP backend no longer adds a default Address line when none is specified in the snmp.conf file; this allows the backend to be easily disabled as needed (Issue #2434) 
- Added a new cupsctl command for doing basic changes to the cupsd.conf file (Issue #1777) 
- Added a new ppdLocalizeIPPReason() function to get the localized text/URI for a given IPP reason keyword for a driver. 
- Removed the deskjet2.ppd driver, as it only worked with a very small subset of HP DeskJet printers and was confusing to users.  The rastertohp driver still supports the deskjet2.ppd options for existing queues. 
- The scheduler did not add a trailing banner page if a client did not specify the last document in a job (Issue #1711) 
- The scheduler did not report Bonjour shared printers as remote printers (Issue #2384) 
- Added new -R and -W options to the cupstestppd program for greater control over the testing of PPDs. 
- Added a new cupsGetServerPPD() function for getting an available PPD from the server (Issue #2334) 
- Added a new cupsDoIORequest() function for reading and writing files via IPP requests (Issue #2334) 
- Added a new CUPS_GET_PPD operation for getting an available PPD file on the server (Issue #2334)  
- CUPS_GET_PPDS now reports multiple ppd-product values based on the PPD ModelName and Product strings (Issue #2334, Issue #2383) 
- CUPS_GET_PPDS now reports the PSVersion attributes from a PPD file in the ppd-psversion attribute (Issue #2334) 
- CUPS_GET_PPDS now reports the cupsModelNumber attribute from a PPD file in the ppd-model-number attribute (Issue #2383) 
- CUPS_GET_PPDS now reports a driver type string in the ppd-type attribute based on the cupsFax and cupsFilter attributes in a PPD file (Issue #2383) 
- Added a new printer attribute called "cups-version" which reports the version of CUPS that is running (Issue #2240) 
- backendRunLoop() now aborts immediately on SIGTERM if no data has been written yet (Issue #2103) 
- Due to poor IPP support from the vendors, the SNMP backend no longer tries IPP connections; instead, it now uses a lookup file with fallback to port 9100 (socket://address) and 515 (lpd://address) printing (Issue #2035, Issue #2354)  
- The scheduler now recreates the CUPS log directory as needed (Issue #2353) 
- cupsLangDefault() now maps new-style Apple locale names to the traditional ll_CC form (Issue #2357) 
- Add new cupsArrayNew2() API to support hashed lookups of array elements (Issue #2358) 
- ppdConflicts() optimizations (Issue #2358) 
- The cupstestppd program now tests for existing filters, icons, profiles, and dialog extensions (Issue #2326) 
- The web interface no longer lists new printers on the main administration page.  Instead, a new "List Available Printers" button is provided that shows a separate page with the list of printers. 
- The web interface now supports setting the banner and policy options on raw printers and classes (Issue #2238) 
- The socket backend now reads any pending back-channel data before shutting down the socket (Issue #2325) 
- Added a new ErrorPolicy directive in the cupsd.conf file (Issue #1871) 
- Printers that use JCL options are now exported to Samba correctly (Issue #1985) 
- The IPP backend now relays printer-state-message values from the server to the client (Issue #2109) 
- Added support for the PWG printer-alert and printer-alert-description attributes (Issue #2088) 
- Added support for LPD "stream" mode (Issue #2036) 
- The scheduler now reports the PostScript product string from PPD files in CUPS-Get-PPDs responses (Issue #1900) 
- Raw printing with queues pointing to the file pseudo-device and multiple files and/or banners now works (Issue #1933) 
- Added new public cupsAdminGetServerSettings() and cupsAdminSetServerSettings() APIs. 
- Added new "makebuttons" script in the "tools" directory for creating web interface buttons (Issue #2231) 
- Added support for DNS-SD (aka "Bonjour") printer sharing (Issue #1171) 
- Job operations (cancel, hold, release, etc.) from the web interface now return back to the original page (Issue #2239) 
- The classes or printers list is now shown after a successful deletion from the web interface (Issue #1999) 
- The default configuration now allows browse packets from any address (Issue #2008) 
- The web interface now provides an "allow printing from the Internet" check box (Issue #1897)

- Added support for Linux "relro" linker option (Issue #1614) 
- CUPS now validates the number-up option value (Issue #1329) 
- The on-line help now provides better search capabilities (Issue #1701) 
- The web interface "Add This Printer" button now allows you to change the printer name, description,  and location (Issue #1646) 
- Added support for Mac OS X authorization services (Issue #2206) 
- Added support for driver-specific pre-filters (Issue #2108) 
- Added a new side-channel API for drivers and backends for basic device control and information queries (Issue #1898) 
- The scheduler now uses poll(), epoll(), or /dev/kqueue instead of select() when possible (Issue #1261) 
- Added new cupsArrayGetIndex() and cupsArrayGetInsert() functions to get the current index and insertion positions of an array. 
- Added a new --with-max-copies configure option (Issue #2090) 
- Added new cupsRemoveDest() and cupsSetDefaultDest() functions. 
- Added support for cupsPJLCharset attribute in PPD files which specifies the character set that is used in PJL strings (Issue #1969) 
- Moved the definition of the (private) _http_s structure to http-private.h; code that directly accesses the http_t members will no longer compile! 
- Added support for setting the document-format-default attribute on a per-printer basis. 
- Added support for IntelliBar label printers.
