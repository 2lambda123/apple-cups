This filter converts GNU troff (groff) sources to PostScript or PDF
and tries to include the needed fonts for PostScript output (for PDF
output, font embedding is already done by the gropdf postprocessor,
depending on the groff installation).

It can be downloaded from
http://sourceforge.net/projects/cupsaddons/files/grofftops/
