CUPS 1.7.0 is primarily a "polish" release release with improved support for paid, PIN, and release printing, expanded support for IPP Everywhere, automatic support for data compression, a new "ippfind" utility, and improved CUPS APIs. Changes since 1.7rc1 include:
- Updated Japanese localization.
- The lpadmin command did not send the PPD name from the "-m" option (<rdar://problem/15264697>)
- Network backends now use the prtMarkerSuppliesClass property to determine the direction of supply level values (<rdar://problem/14302628>)
- The scheduler did not remove backup PPD files when a printer was deleted (<rdar://problem/15065555>)
- The scheduler incorrectly responded to HEAD requests when the web interface was disabled (<rdar://problem/15090332>)
- The scheduler did not respond using the hostname specified by the client (<rdar://problem/14583574>)
- Fax queues did not work when shared via Bonjour (<rdar://problem/14498310>)
- Error messages from the scheduler were not localized using the language specified in the client's IPP request (<rdar://problem/14128011>)
- Added an Italian localization (<rdar://problem/14481578>)
- Fixed a couple memory leaks in ippfind that were reported by Clang.
- Fixed a compile issue on 64-bit Linux with Clang - need to use the -pie option instead of -Wl,-pie now (<rdar://problem/14480938>)
- The ippfind utility reported the wrong port numbers when compiled against Avahi (<rdar://problem/14508324>)
- httpGetFd, httpGetFile, httpPutFd, and httpPutFile did not automatically reconnect if the server closed the connecion after the previous response.
- Fixed a compile error in libcups (<rdar://problem/14467141>)
- The scheduler incorrectly did not pass a FINAL_CONTENT_TYPE environment variable to the filters or backend (<rdar://problem/14355011>)
- The cups-exec helper program could fail randomly on OS X due to sandbox violations when closing excess file descriptors (<rdar://problem/14421943>)
- The scheduler incorrectly did not use the kqueue interface on OS X.

Enjoy!
