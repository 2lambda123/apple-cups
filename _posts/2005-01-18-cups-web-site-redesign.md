After several months of development, we have finally finished the redesign of the CUPS web site. The new site offers:- Hosted articles, which are searchable and can be attached to projects on the links page or standalone. Articles are currently tagged as news announcements, frequently asked questions, or "how-to" articles.- A printer driver database page for publishing your PPD files. The intent is to provide a common repository of PPD files for all CUPS users to enjoy.- User accounts, which allow us to provide developer access to each of the CUPS-related projects and site. User accounts are also required to post comments to the site as well to minimize spamming (you can still post anonymously)In the near future, all of the CUPS software and ESP Ghostscript will be moved to new Subversion repositories administered locally on the CUPS server.If you run into any problems or have suggestions for the new site, please send an email to webmaster@easysw.com.Thanks for your continued support of CUPS! We hope you enjoy the new site!
