A new-and-improved Git mirror of the CUPS software repository is now online. The mirror incorporates the history from both the old Easy Software Products and the current Apple repositories, and is now tracking the development of CUPS 2.0, the next scheduled feature release of CUPS.

Instructions for cloning the sources can be found on the software page at:

    https://www.cups.org/software.html#GIT

Please report any problems with the mirror to the CUPS Developer list.

Enjoy!
