We are still working on version 6 of our CUPS-specific driver for Windows. The driver is not yet available, but in the meantime you can use the standard Windows 2000 PostScript driver. Consult the cupsaddsmb man page for instructions.

The old 5.0 driver is <b>not</b> compatible with current releases of CUPS, and if you install the old driver it will not be used by cupsaddsmb.

We will make future announcements here when the new CUPS driver for Windows is available for download.
