<P>A Software Trouble Report page for CUPS users and developers is now on-line.<P>This page provides electronic access to the trouble reporting system outlined in the CUPS Configuration Management Plan and allows you to post and track bugs, patches, and enhancement requests on-line. This new page should allow us to better track non-commercial CUPS issues much more closely and provide a better open-source product to you.<P>As this page is not intended for general usage support, please continue to take advantage of the free CUPS newsgroups and mailing lists to ask general usage questions.<P>Thank you for using and supporting CUPS!
