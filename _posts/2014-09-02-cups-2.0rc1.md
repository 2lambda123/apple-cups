CUPS 2.0rc1 is the first release candidate for CUPS 2.0. The focus of this major release is mainly on performance and security improvements. Please let us know if you run into any issues with this release candidate via the Bugs page at:

    https://www.cups.org/str.php

Changes in CUPS 2.0rc1 include:

- Documentation updates (Issue #4464)
- The scheduler now monitors the AC power status on OS X, allowing for "sleep printing" when sharing printers (<rdar://problem/17325852>)
- The scheduler incorrectly called launch_activate_socket multiple times on OS X (<rdar://problem/17523218>)
- The ippserver test program now passes the IPP Everywhere self- certification tests (Issue #4101)
- Relaxed the new OS X filter sandbox slightly (Issue #4471, <rdar://problem/17483959>)
- Dropped the old Epson Stylus Color/Photo sample drivers since they don't work with any current printers and there are free alternatives that produce much better output (<rdar://problem/18036889>)
- Log and configuration files that are not world-readable are again accessible via the web interface (Issue #4461)
- PPD files are now created using the permissions specified by the ConfigFilePerm directive.
- Fixed RPM build issues (Issue #4459)
- Fixed the spinner image and restart page when reconfiguring the scheduler through the web interface (Issue #4475)

Enjoy!
