Kurt Pfeifle has written a Draft for the Printing Chapter of the new Samba-3.0 
HOWTO-Collection. It is available at
 
http://www.linuxprinting.org/kpfeifle/SambaPrintHOWTO/Samba-HOWTO-Collection-3.0-PrintingChapter-3rd-draft.html

A PDF version (for convenient printing) is at 
 
http://www.linuxprinting.org/kpfeifle/SambaPrintHOWTO/Samba-HOWTO-Collection-3.0-PrintingChapter-3rd-draft.pdf

The new HOWTO-Collection is due for publication alongside the Samba 3.0 software release, probably sometime in May/June. The HOWTO Collection in all its draft components is already greatly enhanced and extended, and so is the printing part. Please help polish it even further.. 

Please: read it - use it - test its advices & recipes - feed your suggestions back to me. This way you can make the Samba Printing Documentation a better one. (You may also learn a bit from it at no cost at all... ;-)

The most recent PDF version of the complete HOWTO Collection is (until final release) available at

  http://samba.org/~jht/NT4migration/Samba-HOWTO-Collection.pdf
  
(Note that this does not yet include my Samba Printing HOWTO part I am asking you to check and test.)

The printing draft contains 15 ASCII art flowcharts trying to to clarify and explain various aspects of Windows --> Samba printing and of CUPS printfile processing. However, I am not able to convert this into something "nice". So here goes the call to all who are willing and able to help out with their abilities to use one of the Free Software drawing or graphic programs: please provide some better illustrations for this important documentation.
