CUPS 1.7.5 addresses some minor issues and expands upon the symlink security protection. Changes include:

- Security: Addressed some more situations where symlinked files would be served by the web interface (Issue #4455)
- The LPD backend did not work with some versions of glibc (Issue #4452)
- CGI scripts did not work (Issue #4454)
- The cupsd.conf man page did not list the ErrorPolicy directive (Issue #4457)
- Updated the Brazilian Portuguese translation (Issue #4456)

Enjoy!
