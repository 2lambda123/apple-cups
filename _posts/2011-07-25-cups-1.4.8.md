CUPS 1.4.8 is now available for download from:

    http://www.cups.org/software.html

The new release fixes two issues affecting the scheduler and network backends. Changes include:

- The scheduler would delete job data files when restarted (Issue #3880)
- The network backends could crash if a printer returned a value of 0 for the maximum capacity for a supply (Issue #3875)

Enjoy!
