Now that CUPS 1.4 has gone beta, we need people to translate the message catalog and web interface files. Please post comments here if you plan on working on a particular language, and then follow up with your actual translations on the Bugs & Features page.Instructions for translating CUPS can be found in the Translating and Customizing CUPS documentation.
