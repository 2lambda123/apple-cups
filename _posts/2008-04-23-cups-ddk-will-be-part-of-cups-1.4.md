As part of the CUPS 1.4 development, the CUPS DDK is being merged into the main CUPS sources. Aside from making the DDK components standard in every CUPS-based printing environment, we hope this will make providing printer drivers even easier than before.

The current CUPS 1.4 developer snapshots already include the DDK. Future snapshots will add more printer drivers and improvements to the PPD compiler tools.
