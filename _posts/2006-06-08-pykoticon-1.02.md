Summary of changes :

    - Configurable cache to specify the time in
      seconds during which input forms' content will be cached.
      This allows people to avoid retyping their username and
      password, or any other data, for each print job.

    - Doesn't display the Quit menu anymore if not allowed.

    - Doesn't display the ugly traceback anymore when the client
      disconnects before the server has sent the answer back
      (e.g. when using pknotify --timeout).
