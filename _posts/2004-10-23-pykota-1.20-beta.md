Most important changes :    
- Internal handling of SNMP and PJL_over_TCP/9100 print internal page counter querying : this tremendously lowers the CPU usage.  
- Introduction of a data dumper which can export PyKota's datas into CSV, SSV, TSV, and XML formats.  
- Important fixes to the generic  Page Description Language parser which now recognizes DSC Compliant and Binary PostScript, PDF, PCL3, PCL4, PCL5, PCLXL (aka PCL6), and ESC/P2. More than 60 GhostScript output drivers are now recognized.  
- General reliability improvements.  
- Command line tools' help is now internationalized too (for the BETA, only English, French and Spanish are available).  
- Better priviledges delegation : introduction of PyKota administrators.  
- Improved LPRng support.  
- And MUCH more !
