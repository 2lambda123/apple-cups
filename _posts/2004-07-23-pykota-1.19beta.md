<LI>LPRng support rewrite : hardware accounting is now done    immediately, just as with CUPS.
- CUPS support's mainloop rewrite : no more 99% CPU usage troubles.  
- Software accounting now supports PostScript (DSC compliant and     binary), PDF, PCL5, PCL6 (aka PCLXL). A new command line tool     is introduced (pkpgcounter), which can be used independantly     if needed (PyKota has to be installed though, but no config     is necessary).  
- Strict enforcement of quota is now supported : if activated     (not the default), people can't be over quota anymore.  
- Easier configuration. Saner defaults. Improved configuration     helper for CUPS (pkhint).  
- Configurable call-home-on-crash feature to automate bug/problem     reporting to author and/or admin and/or whoever you want.  
- Improved web based reports.  
- More versatile LDAP specific configuration directives.  
- More datas saved in the database :      printer text description, history of payments, job size     in bytes, job originating hostname.  
- X Window Print Quota reminder using On Screen Display (pykosd).  
- Better dispatching of error or informational messages.  
- Improved documentation (a bit).  
- Improved overall robustness.  
- Usual bugfixes.  
- PyKota stuff (T-Shirts, Bags, Mousepads...) can now be bought     from http://www.cafeshops.com/pykota so you can spread the word about this software
