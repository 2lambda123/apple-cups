We will be performing some brief maintenance on the CUPS.org servers this Thursday, May 8th. While the actual maintenance will not take long, there are also some DNS changes that could take several hours to propagate.

The CUPS.org web site, Git mirror, and mailing lists will be unavailable while the maintenance is being performed.

" This maintenance is now complete.
