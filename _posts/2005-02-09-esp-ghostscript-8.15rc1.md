ESP Ghostscript 8.15rc1 is the first release based on GPL Ghostscript 8.15 and includes an enhanced configure script, the CUPS raster driver, many GPL drivers, support for dynamically loaded drivers (currently implemented for the X11 driver), and several GPL Ghostscript bug fixes. The new release also fixes all of the reported STRs from ESP Ghostscript 7.07.x.

In accordance with the CUPS Configuration Management Plan, you now have until Thursday, February 24th to test this release candidate to determine if there are any high-priority problems and report them using the Software Trouble Report form at:

    http://www.cups.org/espgs/str.php

Reports sent to the CUPS newsgroups or mailing lists are not automatically entered into the trouble report database and will not influence the final production release of ESP Ghostscript, so it is very important that you report any problems you identify using the form.
