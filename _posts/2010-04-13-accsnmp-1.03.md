The new release offers several enhancements and bug fixes:
- All script variables can be overridden on a per-queue basis using new "qconf" configuration file format.  Most variables renamed in a more  consistent manner to fit with this scheme.
- New config variables acc_factor and acc_precision, to allow for custom per-queue page accounting, and even fractional values.
- New config variables lock_file and lock_alarm, to allow for multiple accsnmp queues to safely share one printer.
- URI syntax check altered to work with cups-1.4.x
- Signals warn and die are now trapped and send messages to cups error log
- Several bug fixes and improvements
