<P>The fourth release candidate for version 4.4 of ESP Print Pro isnow available for download from the ESP Print Pro web site at:<PRE>    <A HREF="http://www.easysw.com/printpro/rc.php">http://www.easysw.com/printpro/rc.php<P>This release candidate will be available for testing untilFriday, May 28th.  Please test this release candidate todetermine if there are any high-priority problems and reportthem using the problem report form at:<PRE>    <A HREF="http://www.easysw.com/printpro/support.php">http://www.easysw.com/printpro/support.php<P>Bug reports may also be filed using the form at:<PRE>    <A HREF="http://www.easysw.com/printpro/rcbug.php">http://www.easysw.com/printpro/rcbug.php<P>Reports sent to the ESP Print Pro newsgroups or mailing listsare not automatically entered into the trouble report databaseand will not influence the final production release of 4.4, soit is very important that you report any problems you identifyusing the form.<P>ESP Print Pro 4.4 is based on CUPS 1.1.19 and adds support forMacOS X 10.2.x and client support for Windows NT 4.0, Windows2000, and Windows XP. The new release also adds drivers forseveral new EPSON and Lexmark printers and supports printing ofbinary PostScript files to most printers.<P><B>Note for all users: The 4.4 release has increased theconformance requirements for PPD files in order to improvesoftware stability and may not work with existing installed PPDfiles.  The "cupstestppd" utility can be used to manuallydiagnose and fix PPD files in the /etc/cups/ppd directory, oryou can use the "Modify" action in the printer manager toinstall updated PPD files for your printers. We apologize for anyinconvenience this may cause.
