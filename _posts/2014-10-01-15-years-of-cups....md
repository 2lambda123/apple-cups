title: 15 Years of CUPS...

CUPS 1.0 was released [https://web.archive.org/web/20000126074742/http://cups.org/news.html#01OCT1999 15 years ago today], and a lot has changed. That first release supported IPP/1.0, PostScript and CUPS Raster drivers, and network, parallel, serial, and SCSI printers. It even included a copy of GNU Ghostscript to support the PostScript workflow that was standard in 1999.

IPP/2.1, PDF workflow, Bonjour, USB printer support, persistent job history, multiple-file jobs, authentication, encryption, policies, quotas, per-printer sharing controls, and the web interface all came later and have been refined over the last 15 years. Even the CUPS.org web site has changed dramatically - browse through the years in the Wayback Machine link above.

Today our focus on printing is much different than in 1999. Wireless networking and mobile computing are everywhere. We no longer want printer drivers, but expect printers that support standard protocols and formats with fantastic output quality that we could only dream of 15 years ago. And our printing is more focused and personal.

Thank you everyone for helping make CUPS the success it is today, and for helping us to continue to make it better in the future!

Happy Printing!
