Subject: ANNOUNCEMENT: Common UNIX Printing System 1.1.19rc2<P>The second release candidate for version 1.1.19 of the CommonUNIX Printing System ("CUPS") is now available for download fromthe CUPS web site at:<PRE>    <A HREF="http://www.cups.org/software.html">http://www.cups.org/software.html<P>In accordance with the CUPS Configuration Management Plan,you now have until Friday, May 2nd to test this releasecandidate to determine if there are any high-priority problemsand report them using the Software Trouble Report form at:<PRE>    <A HREF="http://www.cups.org/str.php">http://www.cups.org/str.php<P>Reports sent to the CUPS newsgroups or mailing lists are notautomatically entered into the trouble report database and willnot influence the final production release of 1.1.19, so it isvery important that you report any problems you identify usingthe form.<P>CUPS 1.1.19 adds support for fast reconfiguration, optionretension and defaulting when adding and modifying printers,binary PostScript printing, fax device features, custom webapplications via CGI, PHP, Java, and Python, and simplescripting support for Java, Perl, and PHP.  The new release alsocontains bug fixes including the LPD printing and Solaris signalhandling bugs.<P>Changes in CUPS v1.1.19rc2:<UL>	<LI>cupsLangGet() now sets the encoding field based on the	trailing charset in the locale name, and doesn't look	for a message catalog in a specific locale.charset	directory.  This fixes Issue #26 and is more in line	with the CUPS 1.2 implementation.	<LI>The configure script now aborts if the "ar" command or	compilers cannot be found.	<LI>The static cupsimage library was not built by default.	<LI>The path for the "ln" command was hardcoded in	Makedefs.in instead of being checked at configure time	(Issue #28).	<LI>Banner pages containing unescaped { characters would	not work.	<LI>The printer-state-time collection attribute was	encoded as an enumeration instead of an integer.	<LI>The printer-is-accepting-jobs collection attribute was	was not added to the collection value.	<LI>The printer-state-sequence-number collection attribute	was not added to the collection value.	<LI>Fixed typo and const mismatch in IPP backend.	<LI>Updated the man pages for the new configuration	directives.	<LI>Updated the SAM for MacOS 10.2, the CUPS drivers for	windows, the available LPD backend options, and the	new configuration directives.	<LI>The imagetops filter didn't position images properly	on the page (Issue #18)	<LI>The configure script didn't add CPPFLAGS to the	compiler options or LDFLAGS to the DSO options (STR	#13)	<LI>The scheduler would try to write a debug log message	when starting a job that contained a NULL string. 	Since not all versions of snprintf() support NULL	string pointers this caused some problems (Issue #20)	<LI>The testipp program now supports reading of IPP	message files such as those used for the job history	in /var/spool/cups.
