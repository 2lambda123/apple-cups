CUPS 1.7.4 fixes several networking and build issues, and addresses a symlink security issue in the web interface. Changes include:

- Security: The web interface incorrectly served symlinked files and files that were not world-readable, potentially leading to a disclosure of information (Issue #4450)
- The CUPS headers incorrectly needed libdispatch for blocks support (Issue #4397)
- CUPS did not compile when Avahi or mDNSResponder was not present (Issue #4402, Issue #4424)
- The "snmp" option did not work with the network backends (Issue #4422)
- The User directive in client.conf did not override the USER environment variable (Issue #4426)
- The web interface now properly shows a "Go" button for all text-based browsers (Issue #4425)
- The MaxJobTime directive now properly supports time values (Issue #4434)
- The RPM spec file did not work due to the new Brazilian Portuguese localization (Issue #4436)
- Fixed an "IPP read error" issue (Issue #4440)
- Fixed the --disable-libusb configure option (Issue #4439)
- Fixed the debug output from the DNS-SD backend when using Avahi (Issue #4444)
- Fixed a bug in the CUPS_SC_GET_DEVICE_ID handling by the network backends (Issue #4447)
- Added USB quirk rule for Lexmark E230 (Issue #4448)
- The LPD backend did not work with some versions of glibc (Issue #4452)

Enjoy!
