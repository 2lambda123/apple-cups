RasterView is a CUPS raster file viewer for CUPS 1.2 and higher. It basically allows you to look at the raster data produced by any of the standard CUPS RIP filters (cgimagetoraster, cgpdftoraster, imagetoraster, and pstoraster) and is normally used to either test those filters or look at the data that is being sent to your raster printer driver.
