CUPS 1.7.1 improves network and USB printing, fixes some scheduler issues, and addresses a minor security issue in the lppasswd program. Changes include:

- Security: the lppasswd program incorrectly used settings from ~/.cups/client.conf (Issue #4319)
- Auto debug logging was broken in 1.7.0 (<rdar://problem/15331639>)
- Some gzip'd PPD files could not be used (<rdar://problem/15386424>)
- Cleaned up some job logging in the scheduler (<rdar://problem/15332672>)
- ATTR messages could cause string pool memory corruption in the scheduler (<rdar://problem/15382819>)
- The RPM spec file did not list the build requirements; this was on purpose, but now we are listing the Red Hat package names (<rdar://problem/15375760>, Issue #4322)
- Printing to a raw queue could result in corrupt output due to opportunistic compression (<rdar://problem/15008524>)
- The GNU TLS support code triggered many compiler warnings due to the use of old GNU TLS compatibility type names (<rdar://problem/15392966>)
- The "make check" test suite did not work on Linux without the cups-filters package installed (<rdar://problem/14292998>)
- Japanese PPDs using with the Shift-JIS encoding did not work (<rdar://problem/15427759>)
- "tel:" URIs incorrectly had slashes (<rdar://problem/15418463>)
- The libusb-based USB backend incorrectly used write timeouts (<rdar://problem/15564888>)
- Shared printers could become inaccessible after a few days on OS X (<rdar://problem/15426838>)
- The IPP backend did not wait for a busy printer to become available before attempting to print (<rdar://problem/15465667>)
- CUPS did not support "auto-monochrome" or "process-monochrome" for the "print-color-mode" option (<rdar://problem/15482520>)
- Using "@IF(name)" in an Allow or Deny rule did not work (Issue #4328)
- lpq and lpstat did not list jobs in the correct order when priorities were specified (Issue #4326)
- The D-BUS notifier did not remove its lockfile (Issue #4314)
- CUPS incorrectly used the USER environment variable when the name did not match the user ID (Issue #4327)

Enjoy!
