CUPS 2.0.2 is now available from:

    http://www.cups.org/software.html

The new release addresses a potential buffer overflow for compressed raster data and includes several general bug fixes. Changes include:

- Security: cupsRasterReadPixels buffer overflow with invalid page header and compressed raster data (Issue #4551)
- Command-line programs were not localized on Mac OS X (<rdar://problem/14546232>)
- The scheduler incorrectly cleared the MakeModel string in the printers.conf file after a restart (<rdar://problem/16827518>)
- CUPS did not compile with older versions of GNU TLS (Issue #4527)
- CUPS did not compile without Avahi or mDNSResponder (Issue #4523)
- ippLength() did not return the correct length for IPP_TAG_CONST string values.
- The scheduler incorrectly aborted jobs after a job was restarted (<rdar://problem/19129387>)
- The cups-files.conf file contained the old ServerCertificate/Key directives instead of ServerKeychain.
- Fixed builds when no SSL/TLS library is available, or when explicitly disabled (Issue #4531)
- Fixed an OpenBSD charset transcoding issue.
- Fixed USB printing on OpenBSD (Issue #4525)
- The --without-xinetd configure option did not work (Issue #4542)
- Backends needing to load OS X kernel extensions did not work (<rdar://problem/19015679>)
- Mapping of PPD keywords to IPP keywords did not work if the PPD keyword was already an IPP keyword (<rdar://problem/19121005>)
- cupsGetPPD* sent bad requests (Issue #4567)
- ippserver used the wrong temporary directory on Windows (Issue #4547)
- ippserver did not handle Bonjour registrations properly (Issue #4548)
- The scheduler could crash during shutdown if Avahi was shutdown first (Issue #4550)
- Added a USB quirk rule for Intermec printers (Issue #4553)
- The scheduler did not always log which configuration file had the error (Issue #4559)
- The ippfind and ipptool programs now correctly match hostnames with trailing dots (Issue #4563)
- The ipptool timeout option did not work (Issue #4515)
- Fixed several issues with client.conf, CUPS_SERVER, and the "-h" option of most commands (Issue #4528)
