Effective immediately, the CUPS Imaging library (libcupsimage*) is now provided under the same license as the CUPS API library, version 2 of the GNU Library General Public License. This change allows printer manufacturers and driver developers to ship CUPS raster drivers with or without source on all operating systems.
The license change will appear in the next stable release (1.2.6) and 1.3.x developer snapshot, and is retroactively available for CUPS 1.1 and later.
