Computation of ink coverage is now supported. For each page, the percent of coverage for each ink can be computed in one of four different colorspaces. This computation can currently be done for the following file formats : PostScript, PDF, PCL3/4/5, PCLXL, DVI and TIFF (some TIFF documents don't work yet though).
