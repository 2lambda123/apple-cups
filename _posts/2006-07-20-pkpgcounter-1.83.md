A very nasty bug was introduced in pkpgcounter v1.82 which prevented files in the TIFF, DVI, ESC/P2, OpenDocument and ZjStream formats to be detected correctly. Other recognized file formats were still correctly detected though. 

This new release fixes the problem, and people are advised to upgrade as soon as possible.
