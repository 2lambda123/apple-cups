The new release fixes some IPP and USB printing issues. Changes include:

- Documentation updates (Issue #4112, Issue #4130, Issue #4134)
- Fixes for libusb-based USB backend (Issue #4128)
- The lpq command did not show the owner or title of jobs unless passed a username on the command-line (Issue #4135)
- Localized empty strings contained the message catalog metadata (Issue #4119)
- Fixed a crash in the libusb-based USB backend (Issue #4099)
- The cups-lpd mini-daemon no longer handled jobs with multiple copies (Issue #4118)
- Multiple libusb backend fixes (Issue #4098, Issue #4100)
- The IPP backend no longer tries to get the job status for printers that do not implement the required operation (Issue #4083)
- Sending a document in an unsupported format to an IPP printer now automatically cancels the job (Issue #4093)
- Fix some error reporting issues when printing from /dev/null and other unusual situations (Issue #4015)
- The scheduler now sets the CUPS_MAX_MESSAGE environment variable for filters (Issue #4074)
- Fixed a build issue when using older versions of autoconf (Issue #4084)
- The IPP backend now treats the client-error-not-possible status code as a job history issue, allowing IPP printing to Windows to work (Issue #4047)
- The IPP backend incorrectly included the document-format and compression attributes in Create-Job requests (Issue #4086)
- The libusb-based USB backend did not work on non-Linux platforms (Issue #4088)

Enjoy!
