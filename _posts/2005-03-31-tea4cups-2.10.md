  * The job's billing code, if present, is now available from your script in the TEABILLING environment variable.
  * The job's IPP message file (usually /var/spool/cups/c?????) is now available from your scripts in the TEACONTROLFILE environment variable.
  * A simple example showing how to automate the deletion of duplicate print jobs is now included in the sample configuration file.
  * A dedicated mailing list is now available.
