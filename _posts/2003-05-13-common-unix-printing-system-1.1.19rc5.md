<P>The fifth release candidate for version 1.1.19 of the CommonUNIX Printing System ("CUPS") is now available for download fromthe CUPS web site at:<PRE>    <A HREF="http://www.cups.org/software.html">http://www.cups.org/software.html<P>In accordance with the CUPS Configuration Management Plan,you now have until Tuesday, May 27th to test this releasecandidate to determine if there are any high-priority problemsand report them using the Software Trouble Report form at:<PRE>    <A HREF="http://www.cups.org/str.php">http://www.cups.org/str.php<P>Reports sent to the CUPS newsgroups or mailing lists are notautomatically entered into the trouble report database and willnot influence the final production release of 1.1.19, so it isvery important that you report any problems you identify usingthe form.<P>CUPS 1.1.19 adds support for fast reconfiguration, optionretension and defaulting when adding and modifying printers,binary PostScript printing, fax device features, custom webapplications via CGI, PHP, Java, and Python, and simplescripting support for Java, Perl, and PHP.  The new release alsocontains bug fixes including the LPD printing and Solaris signalhandling bugs.<P>Changes in CUPS v1.1.19rc5:<UL>	<LI>Jobs with banner pages that were printed to implicit	classes would get double banner pages for each	file/banner in the job (Issue #68)	<LI>The mime.convs file was missing the filter definition	for Windows BMP (image/x-bitmap) files (Issue #85)	<LI>The scheduler allowed some READ-ONLY job attributes to	be set, which could cause the scheduler to fail on the	next restart (Issue #82)	<LI>The lp and lpr commands did not report when the	scheduler was not responding; instead, the user would	incorrectly see a "no default destination" error (STR	#70)	<LI>cupsLangGet() could fail on OSX due to a corrupt	language preference (Issue #78)	<LI>Added more checks for HTTP request timeouts.	<LI>The scheduler dropped the first non-alpha character	after an open brace when doing attribute substitutions	in banner pages (Issue #77)	<LI>The scheduler child might send SIGUSR1 to the parent	before the signal handler was installed; this didn't	prevent the scheduler from starting but produced an	annoying error message (Issue #45)
