<P>The sixth release candidate for version 1.1.20 of the CommonUNIX Printing System ("CUPS") is now available for download fromthe CUPS web site at:<PRE>    <A HREF="http://www.cups.org/software.html">http://www.cups.org/software.html<P>In accordance with the CUPS Configuration Management Plan,you now have until Friday, November 21st to test this releasecandidate to determine if there are any high-priority problemsand report them using the Software Trouble Report form at:<PRE>    <A HREF="http://www.cups.org/str.php">http://www.cups.org/str.php<P>Reports sent to the CUPS newsgroups or mailing lists are notautomatically entered into the trouble report database and willnot influence the final production release of 1.1.20, so it isvery important that you report any problems you identify usingthe form.<P>CUPS 1.1.20 is primarily a bug fix and performance tuningrelease and includes fixes for 64-bit platforms, deadlockproblems in the signal handling code, PDF printing issues, webinterface issues, and various operating system-specific issues.The new release also adds new CUPS API functions for reading andwriting files via HTTP, performing authentication, andcontrolling the required PPD conformance level.<P>Changes in CUPS v1.1.20rc6:<UL>	<LI>"lp -i jobid -H restart" would often return an error	even though the job restarted successfully (Issue #362)	<LI>The scheduler did not check for invalid allow/deny	addresses such as "11.22.33.44/24". It now masks off	the extra address bits and logs a warning message in	the error_log file (Issue #337)	<LI>The cupstestppd utility now checks for missing	ImageableArea and PaperDimension attributes for each	defined PageSize (Issue #365)	<LI>The IPP code did not wait for a reply indefinitely on	HTTP connections in "blocking" mode (Issue #377)	<LI>The web interfaces did not rewrite the default printer	URI properly (Issue #369 and #299)	<LI>The LPD backend passed the C and L commands in the	wrong order (Issue #378)	<LI>The Dymo label printer driver did not set the label	length properly (Issue #373)	<LI>The scheduler did not support job IDs higher than	99999 (Issue #371)	<LI>The Visual C++ project files did not work (Issue #366)	<LI>The scheduler's cupsLangSeek() function did not reset	the "EOF" flag, preventing compressed files from being	typed properly in some cases (Issue #368)	<LI>The cupsLangGet() cache was only used if the locale	name provided an explicit character set name (STR	#354)	<LI>The CUPS API convenience functions did not call	cupsLangFree() when they were done with the	localization data (Issue #354)	<LI>The scheduler did not return the	job-hold-until-supported or job-hold-until-default	attributes (Issue #356)	<LI>The cupsaddsmb program did not support the new CUPS	driver for Windows (Issue #357)
