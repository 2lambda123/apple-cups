- The documentation for classes.conf and printers.conf did not provide the correct instructions for manual changes (Issue #3351)
- The scheduler did not always rebuild printer cache files when the driver was changed (Issue #3356)
- The documentation makefile failed to install localizations when using newer versions of Bash (Issue #3360)
- The configure script did not use the --with-xinetd value for the default LPD configuration path (Issue #3347)

- The scheduler did not remove old pre-filters when updating a printer driver (Issue #3342)
- The HP/GL-2 filter did not check for early end-of-file (Issue #3319)
