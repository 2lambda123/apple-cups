CUPS 1.4.0 adds over 67 changes and new features to CUPS 1.3.11, including improved Bonjour/DNS-SD support, supply level and status reporting for network printers via SNMP, an improved web interface, and the CUPS DDK tools.

Changes since 1.4rc1 include:

- Localization updates (Issue #3223, Issue #3246, Issue #3248, Issue #3250)
- Documentation updates (Issue #3225, Issue #3230, Issue #3242, Issue #3260)
- The --with-pdftops configure option did not accept a full path to the filter (Issue #3278)
- The banner filter did not position the back side image correctly (Issue #3277)
- The dnssd backend could crash (Issue #3272)
- The 1284 device ID sometimes contained trailing garbage (Issue #3266)
- The USB backend returned different URIs for some printers than in CUPS 1.3 (Issue #3259)
- The scheduler did not do local job-hold-until processing for remote queues (Issue #3258)
- The scheduler did not try all possible SSL certificates on Mac OS X.
- The scheduler did not always remove a file descriptor when using the kqueue interface (Issue #3256)
- The scheduler did not protect against bad job control files in all cases (Issue #3253)
- The scheduler did not encode "+" in model names (Issue #3254)
- The web interface didn't show the default options (Issue #3244)
- The IPP and LPD backends needed print data before they would do an SNMP query.
- Fixed a GNU TLS compatibility issue (Issue #3231)
- Fixed a HTML error in the add and modify printer web interface templates (Issue #3229)
- The scheduler did not minimize the number of printer state events that were generated by filter STATE: messages, which could lead to poor performance.
- The USB backend on Mac OS X did not cleanly cancel a job.
- The network backends now set the connecting-to-device printer-state- reasons value when looking up the address and copying the print data for consistency.
- The scheduler now supports the com.apple.print.recoverable-warning reason on all platforms.
