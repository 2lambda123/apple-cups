Codehost to include portions of CUPS source for use with BrightQ&reg; Printing Suite
CULVER CITY, CA and HOLLYWOOD, MD&nbsp; January 16, 2003 - Software developers Codehost, Inc. and Easy Software Products announced today that the two companies have entered into a licensing agreement that will allow Codehost to utilize aspects of the Common UNIX Printing System (CUPS) source code. The CUPS source code will be used within BrightQ&reg;, Codehost's popular turnkey printing suite for corporate UNIX and Linux users of multi-function devices and high-end printers.
&ldquo;With the inclusion of CUPS source code, Codehost is capitalizing on what is emerging as an industry standard in Linux and UNIX print systems.&nbsp;&nbsp; While we have included some CUPS code in our product, BrightQ&reg; still retains its ability to function with or without CUPS acting as the default print system,&rdquo; said Eric Levy, Codehost's General Manager of printing systems.&nbsp;
Codehost has merged components of the CUPS technology with the advanced installation, print queue management, and sophisticated vendor centric filters, and parsers of the BrightQ&reg; printing suite. This allows Codehost to further protect its OEM partner's investments while increasing the scalability and interoperability of BrightQ&reg;.
&ldquo;Having access to the Easy Software development team's deep knowledge of UNIX and Linux printing allows us to grow to meet both technical and market demands,&rdquo; said Codehost CEO Sam Bizri. &ldquo;In the long term, this relationship will enable us to channel the appropriate resources as we extend our products and services to include undeveloped and untapped areas of corporate printing and imaging solutions.&rdquo;
