Two major bugs were fixed, first one wrt LPRng support and second one wrt increasing or decreasing a user's account balance.
Some minor bugs were also fixed.
Finally an LDAP schema and sample LDIF file are included, which will serve as the basis for the future LDAP storage support. People are encouraged to look at them, try them, and discuss them on PyKota's mailing list.
