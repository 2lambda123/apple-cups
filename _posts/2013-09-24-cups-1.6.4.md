CUPS 1.6.4 fixes some minor printing issues, add support for USB "quirks" files on Linux, and adds a new cupsd SyncOnClose directive. Changes include:
- Removed some duplicate size definitions for some ISO sizes that were causing problems (<rdar://problem/14722721>)
- The IPP backend did not add the "last-document" attribute (<rdar://problem/114660379>)
- Added a SyncOnClose directive to cups-files.conf to force cupsd to call fsync before closing any configuration/state files it writes (<rdar://problem/14523043>)
- Added USB quirk rule for Lexmark E238 (<rdar://problem/14493054>)
- Closed server connections were still not always detected (<rdar://problem/14484313>)
- The libusb-based USB backend now loads its list of quirks from files in /usr/share/cups/usb instead of using a hardcoded table (<rdar://problem/14442769>)
- The scheduler did not properly register ICC color profiles with colord (<rdar://problem/14455625>)

Enjoy!
