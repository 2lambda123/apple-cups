The second release candidate for version 1.0 of the Common UNIX Printing System Driver Development Kit is now available for download from the CUPS web site at:

     http://www.cups.org/ddk.php

This release candidate fixes several problems with the makefiles, updates the documentation, and adds a small utility called "ppdhtml" for creating HTML summaries of the drivers you create.
The CUPS Driver Development Kit (DDK) provides a suite of standard drivers, a PPD file compiler, and other utilities that can be used to develop printer drivers for CUPS and other printing environments.  CUPS provides a portable printing layer for UNIXÂ®-based operating systems.  The CUPS DDK provides the means for mass-producing PPD files and drivers/filters for CUPS-based printer drivers.
