The new cups.org server is now going through its final phase of testing and we hope to have it online in the coming months. In the meantime we have updated the temporary bugs page to point to several alternative bug trackers that can be used to report issues, and a GIT mirror of the live CUPS repository is now accessible as well. New CUPS and ipptool releases are planned for later this week.
