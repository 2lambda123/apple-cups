PyKota v1.22 is now available.

This minor update doesn't require any database change, but still provides important new features :

  - The print quote generator is now also web-enabled.
  - The job's billing code is now saved into the database and can serve    as a filter for the data dumper.
 - The banner generator is more powerful and allows printing of  admin-supplied dynamically generated information.
  - Several stability improvements and bug fixes.
