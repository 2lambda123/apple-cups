<P>The second beta-quality release of CUPS 1.2 is now available for download from the CUPS web site which fixes a PostScript filter bug and adds support for separate 32/64-bit libraries on IRIX, Linux, and Solaris. We are also providing binary packages for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 (32-bit + 64-bit Intel), Fedora Core 4 (32-bit Intel), and MacOS X 10.4 (32-bit PowerPC + Intel) for your convenience.</P><P>In accordance with the updated <A HREF="documentation.php/spec-cmp.html">CUPS Developers Guide</A>, we will have at least a two-week beta test period followed by another two-week release candidate period to resolve any issues in the 1.2 release. <B>Report all problems with the beta release on the following page:</B><PRE>    <A HREF="http://www.cups.org/str.php">http://www.cups.org/str.php</A></PRE><P>Reports sent to the CUPS newsgroups or mailing lists are not automatically entered into the trouble report database and will not influence the final production release of CUPS 1.2, so it is very important that you report any problems you identify using the form.</P><P>Changes in CUPS 1.2b2:</P><UL>
- Updated the CUPS design description. 
- Added --enable-32bit and --enable-64bit configure options to allow building of separate 32/64-bit libraries on systems that support both environments (<A HREF="http://www.cups.org/str.php?L1472">Issue #1472</A>) 
- Various compiler warning fixes. 
- Fixes for Solaris 10 builds against old GNU TLS and LDAP libraries. 
- Added a cupsArrayUserData() function to retrieve the user data pointer for an array (useful for typing arrays) 
- The ppdEmitString() function did not compute the required buffer size properly, leading to dropped characters on the end of the printer commands in pstops and imagetops (<A HREF="http://www.cups.org/str.php?L1470">Issue #1470</A>) </UL>
