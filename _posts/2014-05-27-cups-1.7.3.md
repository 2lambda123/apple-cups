- Added Brazilian Portuguese translation (Issue #4409)

- Several ippGet* functions incorrectly returned -1 instead of 0 on error.
- The cupsGetResponse function did not work properly with CUPS_HTTP_DEFAULT (<rdar://problem/16762593>)
- The IPP backend did not abort a job when the printer did not validate the supplied options (<rdar://problem/16836752>)
- Fixed an authentication race condition in cupsSendRequest (Issue #4403)
- The scheduler did not add the "job-hold-until-specified" reason when holding a job using the lp command (Issue #4405)
- The CUPS headers incorrectly needed libdispatch for blocks support (Issue #4397)
- The configure script incorrectly added libgcrypt as a GNU TLS dependency (Issue #4399)
- CUPS did not compile when Avahi or mDNSResponder was not present (Issue #4402)
- cupsGetDestMediaCount did not work for CUPS_MEDIA_FLAGS DEFAULT (Issue #4414)
- Auto-typing of PWG Raster files did not work (Issue #4417)
- IPP queues using hardcoded credentials would ask for credentials (Issue #4371)
- Dates in non-UTF-8 locales did not display correctly (Issue #4388)
