This new release features :

    * The distribution method is now identical to PyKota's : Subversion access is available for no fee to all, but people are invited to purchase yearly subscriptions to Official Tea4CUPS packages.
    * Pre and Post hooks, which are respectively launched before and after  the print job has been sent to the real backend (if any).
    * Prehooks can decide to entirely cancel the print job if needed (easy versatile print quotas for example).
    * Original CUPS backend's exit code is available in posthooks.
    * prehooks, posthooks and tees are now launched in alphabetical order.
