This new release features :
  - Now works with old releases of Python like 2.1
  - Error handling code was improved.
  - Errors in posthooks are ignored because the print job was already printed successfully when they are launched, so there's no reason to stop the print queue.
  - Technical support contracts are now available and include a free subscription to Official packages.
