title: GPL Ghostscript 8.15 Integration In Progress
layout: post
---

Work has begun on integrating ESP Ghostscript with the GPL Ghostscript 8.15 baseline. We now have a Subversion repository for ESP Ghostscript (http://svn.easysw.com/public/espgs/trunk) which has the following items completed:

- Import of GPL Ghostscript 8.15 sources
- Application of CUPS driver patches and configure script changes to support printing from CUPS.
- Application of shared library patches to support better packaging and integration on Linux.

We will be focusing on testing and documentation now and hope to do a quick 8.15.1 release in the near future.
