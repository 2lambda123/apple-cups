This means that everyone will be able to use the latest Ghostscript and contribute fixes back to the core - no more lag between GPL Ghostscript and ESP Ghostscript!

Ralph Giles (another Ghostscript developer) is looking for a developer (via a paid contract) to help move this effort forward and integrate open source drivers like those in ESP Ghostscript:
