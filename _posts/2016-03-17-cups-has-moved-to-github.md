By popular request, CUPS is now hosted on Github. All bugs have been migrated to the Github issue tracker and the git repository has been updated to contain the missing release tags and branches since 1.7.0.

In the coming weeks we will be moving the CUPS.org web site over to Github hosting as well.

Please let us know if you encounter any difficulties by sending an email to webmaster@cups.org.
