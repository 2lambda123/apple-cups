We need translators for CUPS 1.2! The first beta release of CUPS 1.2 includes English and Japanese localizations. We'd like to include as many languages as possible when 1.2 goes stable.

If you'd like to contribute a translation, please read the translation guide on the documentation page:

    http://www.cups.org/documentation.php/translation.html

Contributors will get their name in the CREDITS file and the gratitude of millions of CUPS users!
