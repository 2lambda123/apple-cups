CUPS 1.4.6 is now available for download from:

    http://www.cups.org/software.html

The new release fixes landscape printing, sharing, and fax issues. Changes include:

- Fixed a "make check" issue on Solaris (Issue #3729)
- Regression: The pstops filter did not support landscape printing of PostScript files (Issue #3722)
- The scheduler killed retried (fax) jobs after restarting them (Issue #3697)
- The cupsAdminSetServerSettings() function disabled sharing when debug logging was enabled (Issue #3712)

Enjoy!
