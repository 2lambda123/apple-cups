CUPS provides the System V and Berkeley command-lineinterfaces.<P>CUPS uses the Internet Printing Protocol ("IPP") as the basisfor managing print jobs and queues.

CUPS adds network printer browsing and PostScriptPrinter Description ("PPD") based printing options to supportreal-world printing under UNIX.<P>CUPS includes an image file RIP that supports printing of imagefiles to non-PostScript printers.
