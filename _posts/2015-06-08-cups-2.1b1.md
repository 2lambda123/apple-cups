    http://www.cups.org/software.html

CUPS 2.1 improves IPP Everywhere support, including a new dynamic IPP Everywhere driver. The new release also adds advanced logging on systems using ASL or journald and adds new security features to minimize exposure. Changes include:

- Improved speed of ppdMarkDefaults for complex/large PPDs (<rdar://problem/15146999>)
- The IPP backend now stops sending print data if the printer indicates the job has been aborted or canceled (<rdar://problem/17837631>)
- The IPP backend now sends the job-pages-per-set attribute when printing multiple copy jobs with finishings (<rdar://problem/16792757>)
- The IPP backend now updates the cupsMandatory values when the printer configuration changes (<rdar://problem/18126570>)
- No longer install banner files since third-party banner filters now supply their own (Issue #4518)
- Added support for EXPECT-ALL directive in ipptool test files (Issue #4469)
- Added support for WITH-VALUE-FROM predicate in ipptool test files (Issue #4470)
- The scheduler no longer listens on the loopback interface unless the web interface or printer sharing are enabled (<rdar://problem/9136448>)
- Added a PPD generator for IPP Everywhere printers (Issue #4258)
- Now install "default" versions of more configuration files (<rdar://problem/19024491>)
- The cupstestppd program did not handle "maxsize(nnn)" entries in cupsFilter/cupsFilter2 values (<rdar://problem/18974858>)
- The scheduler now checks the return value of rename() calls (Issue #4589)
- The scheduler now validates ErrorPolicy values in config files (Issue #4591)
- Long cookies caused the web interface to stop working (Issue #4619)
- Added SSLOptions values to allow Diffie-Hellman key exchange and disable TLS/1.0 support.
- Updated the scheduler to support more IPP Everywhere attributes (Issue #4630)
- The scheduler now supports advanced ASL and journald logging when "syslog" output is configured (Issue #4474)
- The scheduler now supports logging to stderr when running in the foreground (Issue #4505)

Enjoy!
