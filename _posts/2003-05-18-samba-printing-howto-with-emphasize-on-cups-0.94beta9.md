layout: post
---

The Draft for the Printing Chapter of the new Samba 3.0 HOWTO-Collection  has been updated. The version now is 0.94beta9. (That means I regard it as 94% finished.... hmmm, the last 6% seem to be harder than the first 60   ;-) 
It is available at      http://www.linuxprinting.org/kpfeifle/SambaPrintHOWTO/  A PDF version (for convenient printing) is also there.
This is from the document's Changelog: 
    
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   06-05-2003: a lot of typos corrected -- most is spellchecked now
               checked some of my recipes (they still worked ;-)
               wrote a few sentences about printing *from* Samba *to* CUPS
               include more rundll32 examples (one using also "runas")
   
   17-05-2003: integrated most of the feedback comments from various people.
               A lot of feedback from Ken Sarkies -- thanks a lot!
               Ciprian Vizitiu crafted the PNG flowcharts from my original ASCII 
 	      art. Wow!
                        (a few bugs and typos in the PNGs need to be corrected.)
     ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
The Samba 3.0 HOWTO-Collection is due for publication alongside the Samba 3.0 software release, probably sometime in May/June. The complete collection of docus is already greatly enhanced and extended, compared to the 2.2.x versions, and so is the printing part. (BTW, most of this is valid for 2.2.x printing too...)
You can help to further polish it: read it - use it - test its advices & recipes - feed your suggestions back to me. Especially useful at this point are checks for the accuracy of descriptions regarding Windows 2000 + Windows NT (and even Windows 9x) clients. Since I have done most of the work with WinXP clients, you should check if the docu is usable for WinNT/2K too. Also, my Windows UI is German and error messages pop up in German -- so had to translate it into English. Please check for inaccurately translated strings and descriptions. 
The most recent PDF version of the complete HOWTO Collection is (until final release) available at     http://samba.org/~jht/NT4migration/Samba-HOWTO-Collection.pdf  
and also in the Samba HEAD CVS. (Note that this does not yet include my Samba Printing HOWTO. The printing chapter(s) contained there will be completely replaced.)
Thanks, Kurt
