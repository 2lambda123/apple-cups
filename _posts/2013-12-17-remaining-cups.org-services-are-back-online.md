After a very long absence, I am pleased to announce that the CUPS.org bug database is back!  CUPS.org login accounts, along with all bug reports, have been restored from the old web site.

The CUPS forums are now delivered using GNU mailman exclusively (no more NNTP access), with the cups.bugs, cups.ddk, and cups.development newsgroups merged into a single cups-devel mailing list and cups.announce and cups.general merged into the cups mailing list. Both of the merged lists were populated with an archive of the old NNTP server messages and can be searched.  You can subscribe to the new lists on the Lists page.

Sadly, a few things will not be coming back to CUPS.org, including the PPD (driver) database and the live Subversion repository. However, we are planning on providing a read-only GIT mirror of the CUPS Subversion repository - more on that once we have it working reliably for all active branches.

If you run into problems, please send email to the webmaster or file a bug.

Thank you for your patience, and welcome to the new CUPS.org!
