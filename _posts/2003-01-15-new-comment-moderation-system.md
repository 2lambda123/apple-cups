title: New comment moderation system
layout: post
---

<P>I have put up a simple moderation system for comments that are posted to news articles, polls, and bazaar links. Here is how it works:<UL><LI>You can now submit comments and they will appear immediately.<LI>Each comment has a score associated with it with a value from 0 to 5. Comments start with a score of 2 and will disappear from the site if the score goes to 0.<LI>Each visitor is given 5 moderation "points" every 2 days.<LI>Visitors can moderate your comment up or down 1 point.<LI>Once you have used up your points, you cannot moderate again until you are given another 5 points.<LI>Moderation points are not accummulated; that is, you can't wait 10 days to get 25 moderation points.</UL><P>Comments, as always, are appreciated!
