<P>This is the first release candidate of ESP Ghostscript 7.07.1. The new release updates ESP Ghostscript to the current GNU Ghostscript baseline version 7.07, adds a new PCL XL/PCL 6 driver for CUPS (preliminary support as the current Ghostscript driver does not support duplexing or other printer features), and fixes a number of bugs that have been reported through the software trouble report form.<P>Please report any problems with this release candidate before August 13, 2003 using the form at the following URL:<PRE>    <A HREF="http://www.cups.org/str.php">http://www.cups.org/str.php
