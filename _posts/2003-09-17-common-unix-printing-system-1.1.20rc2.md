<P>The second release candidate for version 1.1.20 of the CommonUNIX Printing System ("CUPS") is now available for download fromthe CUPS web site at:<PRE>    <A HREF="http://www.cups.org/software.html">http://www.cups.org/software.html<P>In accordance with the CUPS Configuration Management Plan,you now have until Wednesday, October 1st to test this releasecandidate to determine if there are any high-priority problemsand report them using the Software Trouble Report form at:<PRE>    <A HREF="http://www.cups.org/str.php">http://www.cups.org/str.php<P>Reports sent to the CUPS newsgroups or mailing lists are notautomatically entered into the trouble report database and willnot influence the final production release of 1.1.20, so it isvery important that you report any problems you identify usingthe form.<P>CUPS 1.1.20 is primarily a bug fix and performance tuningrelease and includes fixes for 64-bit platforms, deadlockproblems in the signal handling code, PDF printing issues, webinterface issues, and various operating system-specific issues.The new release also adds new CUPS API functions for reading andwriting files via HTTP, performing authentication, andcontrolling the required PPD conformance level.<P>Changes in CUPS v1.1.20rc2:<UL>	<LI>The serial backend set the IXANY option on the port	for XON/XOFF flow control; this caused problems with	printers that returned status info but were not ready	for more print data (Issue #287)	<LI>The scheduler didn't support scripted index files	(index.php, index.pl, etc. - Issue #290)	<LI>The scheduler did not correctly localize script files	with "GET" variables (Issue #268)	<LI>Changes in job classification are now logged (STR	#289)	<LI>Fixed a few more SLP-related bugs (Issue #259)	<LI>Updated the user/group configure checks for MacOS X	10.3 (Issue #270)	<LI>Fixed an offset bug in the PDF filter (Issue #284)	<LI>The cupsDoRequest() and cupsDoFileRequest() functions	did not map several HTTP status codes to their IPP	counterparts. This made detecting certain conditions	very difficult (Issue #277)	<LI>Config, spool, and status files are now owned by the	scheduler user (usually root) with read permission for	the filter group (Issue #283)	<LI>The HP-GL/2 filter did not support the SI command,	some values for the AD and SD commands, and did not	rotate labels properly via the DI command (Issue #282)	<LI>The fax support did not update/set the job-hold-until	attribute when a fax job fails (Issue #269)	<LI>The cupsLangGet() function didn't support locales of	the form "ll.charset" (Issue #271)	<LI>The scheduler did not use the charset when getting the	language localization for a request; this caused extra	disk IO for every request (Issue #271)	<LI>The scheduler did not support requests with more than	one language specified (Issue #267)
