This is a minor release which fixes the two bugs below : 
  - Multiple hostnames appeared in the history for a print job when the printer was accessed through ipp, under some particular circumstances. 
  - The --prototype command line option to edpykota didn't work as expected for users without any credits on their account (i.e. limited by quota). Again this only happened under some particular circumstances.

The latest developpment tree, in addition, features :
  - An enhanced data dumper which allows filtering by date when exporting the print history.
 - Configurable URLs for the logo and its destination link in the CGI scripts.

There's now a dedicated website for technical support, and the brand new online FAQ is now available without downloading the software from there :
