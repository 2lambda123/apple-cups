JASmine-0.0.2 is out. There are many new features :
- It is now possible to manage several print servers with a single database server and a single instance of JASmine-Web.  
- Nicer look thanks to the reworked CSS style sheets.  
- Added printer stats.  
- Better navigation through the web interface.  
- Switched from Jerome Alet's "pdl_analyser" to "pkpgcounter".  
- Added a dummy printer backend, to test JASmine without actually printing anything  
- Slightly enhanced the logging system : Now, when in production, JASmine-Backend will be less verbose. The debug logs try to be pertinent and useful.JASmine has a new web site, and documentation has been cleaned : http://nayco3.free.fr/Do not forget the mailing-list:  Send a mail to jasmine-requestATml.free.fr with subject "subscribe"
