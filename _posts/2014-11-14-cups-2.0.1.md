The new release addresses the SSL 3.0 POODLE attack and fixes a number of bugs that have been reported since the 2.0.0 release. Changes include:

- The web interface now protects against frame "click-jacking" attacks (Issue #4492)
- Fixed a crash in ippAttributeString (<rdar://problem/17903871>)
- Fixed a crash in the scheduler on Linux/*BSD if colord was not running (Issue #4496)
- Fixed a random crash in the scheduler when not using systemd (Issue #4484)
- Added systemd support for cups-lpd (Issue #4493)
- The scheduler did not honor the FatalErrors directive for misconfigured Group and SystemGroup values (Issue #4495)
- The network backends no longer report waste-receptacle conditions when using SNMP (Issue #4499)
- The IPP backend did not work with some configurations of Windows (Issue #4503)
- RPMs did not build (Issue #4490)
- Added a USB quirk rule for the Brother HL-1250 (Issue #4519)
- Fixed compiles on unsupported platforms (Issue #4510)
