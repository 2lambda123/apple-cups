While we do everything we can to make CUPS bug-free, it may not always work as
expected.  When this happen we want you to file a report of the issue, including
information such as the operating system or Linux distribution you are using,
the printers and/or applications that are affected, and configuration and/or log
files to help us reproduce the issue and come up with a fix.


Security Bugs
-------------

Security bugs should be sent to <product-security@apple.com>, which is the
dedicated address for security reports at Apple.  Apple will then coordinate
with the various vendors that distribute CUPS so that everyone has a fix and
the disclosure of the issue is done responsibly.


macOS Bugs
----------

Bugs in macOS software (System Preferences, Print dialog, Printer window, or
the version of CUPS included with macOS) should be reported to Apple at
<https://bugreport.apple.com>.


Linux/Printer Driver Bugs
-------------------------

Bugs in Linux software or printer drivers should be reported to the Linux
distributor, the [cups-filters](https://github.com/openprinting/cups-filters)
project, or the printer driver developer.


Other Bugs
----------

Any bugs in the CUPS software itself that do not involve a security
vulnerability should be reported to the
[CUPS Github Issue Tracker](https://github.com/apple/cups/issues).  Pull
requests are also welcome!

> Note: Please report all security bugs to <product-security@apple.com> and
> *not* using the Github issue tracker.  Github does not offer "private" issues
> so any issues reported on Github are instantly visible to everyone.
